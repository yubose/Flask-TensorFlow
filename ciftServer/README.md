# CIFT(Classify Image For Tensorflow) server

###Step 1: bash setup.sh to start docker containers
### You need wait few seconds for the docker container server to get ready
###Step 2: cd unit_test
###Step 3: ./batchTest.api which uses curl to send classify-image API to ciftsever and get a report afterward
###Step 4: more image url can be added to imageUrlList.json, and batchTest.api could read it to send classify-image APIs and get a report

###Step 5: using docker build to build a new docker image
